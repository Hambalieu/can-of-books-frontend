# Can Of Books

**Author**: Hambalieu Jallow, Kevin LaMarca
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
Creating an Online Bookstore Application<br></br>

## Getting Started
- Configured a new repository for our Front end Application
- Added an empty dotenv file <br></br>


## Card 3 
- - In the `BestBooks` component, make a `GET` request to your server `/books` route, in the `componentDidMount` function.<br></br>
- Store the book data returned from the server in the application `state`.<br></br>
- Use conditional logic to only render the books when there are more than 0 books stored in the application state.<br></br>
- When the server does return some books, use a Bootstrap carousel to render all the books returned.<br></br>
- When the server returns no books then render a message that the book collection is empty.<br></br>
- Use React Router to add ability for user to navigate between Profile and Home "pages".C
